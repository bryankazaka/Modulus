# Modulus
Write a program that, given a positive integer, N, and a non-negative integer, Z, counts the number
of pairs of positive integers X and Y (0<X<N, 0<Y<N) for which (X * Y) *modulo* N == Z.
The modulus (or modulo) operation finds the remainder when one number is divided by another.
For example: 8 *modulo* 3 is 2. (This is expressed in C, C++, and Java with the % operator, so 8 % 3
== 2.)
Example:
Given that N = 6 and Z = 3, the following pairs of integers would be counted, giving an answer of 5:
1, 3
3, 1
3, 3
3, 5
5, 3
Note that the order within the pair matters. For example, (1, 3) and (3, 1) are counted as distinct
pairs.
Input and Output
Program input and output will make use of stdio streams (System.in and System.out in
Java) i.e., not file I/O.
Input consists of two lines, the first containing the integer N, and the second containing the integer
Z.
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000
0 ≤ Z < N
Output consists of a single integer (the number of different pairs of positive integers, X and Y, for
which (X * Y) *modulo* N == Z) followed by a line break --- in Java, for example, use
System.out.println, not System.out.print. The automatic marker expects this precise
form.
Sample Input:
6
3
Sample output:
5
